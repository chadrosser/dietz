                <p>Bio: Joshua Ryan Dietz is a writer, director, and producer living in Los Angeles. Over the last decade, he has written nearly 30 screenplays, a novel, and produced both feature and series projects as a development executive for various companies. He was a co-executive producer on David Ayer’s theatrically released film The Tax Collector starring Shia LeBeouf and on Scott Cooper’s The Pale Blue Eye starring Christian Bale. He became a member of the WGA after being hired to adapt the true-story of Chris George and his Wolf of Wall Street-like rise in the corrupt world of pain management. Shortly after, he was hired to rewrite The LaLaurie Mansion, a horror film penned by Chad and Carey Hayes of The Conjuring franchise, based on what is considered one of America’s most haunted homes. Dietz spent nearly 40 nights in the actual house while working on the script. His first produced feature film, Cowboy, wrapped earlier this year. Prior to being in the WGA, he served as a ghost writer on a horror film that was released last year. Dietz is also known for co-creating two critically acclaimed immersive experiences, iConfidant and One Day Die, which received high praise from Neil Patrick Harris, Joe Russo, and many more. He co-created the highly successful, hour-long YouTube show Commander at Home, which quickly grew to having over 150,000 subscribers. Over the most recent strike, he penned his first novel, which he really needs to do a second pass on, but the first draft was a real doozy. When he’s not writing, he’s watching every documentary he can find, hanging with his cat, or doom scrolling on Zillow.</p>
