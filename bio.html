            <p>Joshua Ryan Dietz is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker and former development executive whose work explores obsession, duality, and the often-disorienting edges of human behavior. A storyteller across film, immersive experiences, and digital media, Dietz brings a uniquely psychological lens to genre narratives—often blurring the line between bleak realism and comedic absurdity. </p>
            <p>After nearly a decade in development, where he shepherded projects and wrote nearly thirty screenplays, Dietz shifted his focus to directing his own work. He made his producing debut on David Ayer’s The Tax Collector and later served as co-executive producer on Scott Cooper’s The Pale Blue Eye starring Christian Bale. His creative voice emerged through his writing and immersive storytelling, including the genre-bending experiences iConfidant and One Day Die, praised by artists such as Neil Patrick Harris and Joe Russo. </p>
            <p> His directorial debut short film, Supper, blends dark familial tension with allegorical undercurrents in a darkly comedic tragedy. Supper has played many Oscar Qualifying festivals, including the prestigious HollyShorts, the Cleveland International Film Festival, and several more. Dietz is a Writers Guild of America member and currently developing multiple features, including a haunted-house film The LaLaurie Mansion written while he was living inside the infamous property.</p>
            <p>When not writing, Dietz is utilizing his nerdy passion for Magic the Gathering by producing the highly successful show Commander at Home, or hanging with his wife and cat, or doom scrolling on Zillow. His work invites viewers into stories that are unsettling, layered, and emotionally raw—whether through the lens of horror, drama, or satire.</p>
